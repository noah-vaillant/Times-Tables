# Times-Tables

# The idea behind this code is to set up a circle of points where every point
# has an integer value and applying a factor to them all to see where they
# end up graphically. I take the remainder of the outputted value of every point
# with the amount of points on the circle and plot the output back on the circle.
# This gives way to some stunning pictures.
# This was all inspired by a great youtube video by Mathologer
